summary: Validation tasks for sample-feature
---

## Phase 1: Setup
- [x] T001 Create working files under `specs/sample-feature/`

### DoD
- [x] Skeletons for spec, plan, and tasks are in place

## Phase 2: Foundational
- [x] T002 Check consistency between plan and spec
- [x] T003 (P) Check minimal frontmatter (`status/summary`)

### DoD
- [x] Preconditions are satisfied before implementation starts

## Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1)
Goal: Validate the spec creation flow.
Independent Test: `spec.md` includes requirements.

- [x] T004 [US1] Create `spec.md` for sample-feature

### DoD
- [x] Story and acceptance criteria are testable

## Phase 4: User Story 2 (P2)
Goal: Validate plan and task creation flow.
Independent Test: `plan.md` and `tasks.md` are executable.

- [x] T005 [US2] Create `plan.md`
- [x] T006 [US2] Create `tasks.md` and update progress

### DoD
- [x] Plan and tasks stay aligned with the spec

## Phase 5: Polish
- [x] T007 Record implementation notes in `research/implementation-note.md`

### DoD
- [x] Execution log is recorded
- [x] One cycle is reproducible
